<p>
Whilst studying to become a Software Engineer I have learnt many skills,
some of which help me still to this day (some of which doesn't too)! 
I love solving problems no matter what type. Whether a problem is mental or physical, I am 
always up for a challenge. Curiosity gets the better of me but I won't lie in saying that 
laziness can be an enemy at times! 
I am just looking to share some skills I deem to be handy and also just general thoughts on different 
topics. I hope you enjoy what I have to say and share.
