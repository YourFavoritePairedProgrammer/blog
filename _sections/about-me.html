<p>
I love solving problems no matter what type. Whether a problem is mental or physical, I am 
always up for a challenge. Curiosity gets the better of me but I wont lie in saying that 
laziness can be an enemy at times! Whilst studying to become a Software Engineer I have 
learnt many skills, some of which help me still to this day (some or which doesn't too)! 
I want to now share skills I deem to be handy and also just general thoughts on different 
topics. I hope you enjoy what I have to say an share.
