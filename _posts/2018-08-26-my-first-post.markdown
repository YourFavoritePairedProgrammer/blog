I was thinking for quite some time what I would write my first post about. <br>
Should I do some fancy tutorial with lots of code snippets? <br>
Should I post a deep thought about something? <br><br>
I then realised that less is more sometimes and this post is nothing more than 
a celebration post. A celebration for any readers that might learn a thing or 
two from the posts to come. I'm looking to share an array of different little skills
and hope any reader can harness it and use it practically in any project. <br><br> 
You may or may not be a programmer and you may be young or old. That does not matter. 
You are never too old to learn and its never too early to start!
